								<p>We know firsthand that using a spreadsheet to keep track of contacts and leads is time-consuming, especially when you don't have many leads in the first place. This

							<h2>CRM Secret Sauce</h2>
							<div class="block-desc">
								<p class="mb-2">A CRM can help you understand your customers in a more accurate and detailed way than what's available through your website or other customer touch
									points. </p>
								<p> For example, a lead may visit the site three times before they fill out a web form, but if they're never asked for their phone number or address during that
									process, it might take them months to buy from you. A well-designed CRM will keep track of this information for future reference—and give sales reps access to it
									when necessary.</p>

									want to pay the full price, offer a discount code or even a rebate on the item once they purchase at full price.</p>
